Pay Later Concept

As a pay later service we allow our users to buy goods from a merchant now, and then allow them to pay for those goods at a later date.
The service works inside the boundary of following simple constraints -
● Let's say that for every transaction paid through us, merchants offer us a discount.
○ For example, if the transaction amount is Rs.100, and merchant discount offered to us is 10%, we pay Rs. 90 back to the merchant.
○ The discount varies from merchant to merchant.
○ A merchant can decide to change the discount it offers to us, at any point in time.
● All users get onboarded with a credit limit, beyond which they can't transact.
○ If a transaction value crosses this credit limit, we reject the transaction.
